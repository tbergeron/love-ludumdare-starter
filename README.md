love-ludumdare-starter
======================

LÃ¶ve 2D game development starter kit.

##### Want to throw a quick *ludum dare* game? Take this with you!

This package is built for *personal* purposes only. It contains a few libraries I personally use to get quick prototype done, etc. I also provided a simple game state manager in `state_manager.lua`. Simply follow the pattern of the existing states (`Game.lua` and `Menu.lua`) to get started.

Feel free to contribute and/or report any issues on the github issue tracker.
