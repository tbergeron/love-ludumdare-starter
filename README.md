======================

LÃ¶ve 2D Game Development Starter Bundle.

##### Want to throw a quick *ludum dare* game? Take this with you!

This package is built for *personal* purposes only. It contains a few libraries I personally use to get quick prototype done, etc. I also provided a simple game state manager in `state_manager.lua`. Simply follow the pattern of the existing states (`Game.lua` and `Menu.lua`) to get started.

Most assets are coming from a defunct game called [Glitch](http://glitchthegame.com). I miss that game :(
